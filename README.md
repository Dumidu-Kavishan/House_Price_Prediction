# 🏠 House Prices Prediction using Supervised Learning

This project is a collaborative machine learning study conducted by a team of four members. We used the **House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques** dataset from Kaggle to build and evaluate four different supervised learning models. Each member developed a separate model using a different algorithm to explore the strengths and limitations of various regression techniques.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- The dataset contains various features such as lot size, year built, number of rooms, neighborhood, etc., used to predict the final price of residential homes.

## 🔍 Algorithms Used
Each team member implemented a different supervised learning model:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**
3. **Random Forest Regressor**
4. **Deep Learning (CNN-based)**

## 📈 Objectives
- Understand and compare the performance of different regression models.
- Evaluate models using metrics such as:
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
  - R² Score
- Explore how preprocessing and feature selection affect prediction accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Tensorflow
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks
